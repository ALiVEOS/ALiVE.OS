<English>ALiVE populates the entire map with a full scale war. The AI commanders determine the strategy and use conventional or asymmetric warfare tactics to achieve their goals. Infantry, motorized, mechanized, armored units and aircraft are used to capture or defend strategic objectives across the area of operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AI commanders will call in resupply and reinforcements, close air support and air strikes and recruit insurgencts from the civilian population to plant IEDs and conduct sabotage. Meanwhile, the civilian population actively support or turn against combatants based on their actions and interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a squad playing an ALiVE mission, you must work together to use the tools at your disposal to patrol, identify and attack enemy units, positions and assets. Player Commanders using the ALiVE Menu can manage operations and tasks in coordination with AI commanders.</English>
