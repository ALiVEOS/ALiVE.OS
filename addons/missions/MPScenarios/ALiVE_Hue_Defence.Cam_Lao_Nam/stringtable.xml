<English>ALiVE populates the entire map with a full scale war. Two or more AI commanders fight it out using conventional or asymmetric warfare tactics. Infantry, motorized, mechanized, armored units and aircraft are used to capture or defend strategic objectives across the area of operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AI commanders even call in resupply, reinforcements, close air support, air patrols, air strikes, boat patrols, setup roadblocks, IEDs, conduct suicide bombings and sabotage. Meanwhile, the civilian population actively support or turn against combatants based on their actions and interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a squad playing an ALiVE mission, you must work together to use the tools at your disposal to patrol, identify and attack enemy units, positions and assets. Player Commanders using the ALiVE Menu can manage operations and tasks in coordination with AI commanders.</English>
