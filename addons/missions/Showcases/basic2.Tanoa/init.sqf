<br />
FOB JOHNSTON, BALA AIRFIELD, SW TANOA, GR 021035<br />
Weather: Clear. Visibility 2km+. First Light 0630<br />
<br />
<font size='18'>ENEMY FORCES</font><br />
Intel indicates that a CSAT Combined Arms Armoured Battalion has occupied strategic locations around the <marker name='main_island'>main island</marker> of Tanoa. The main body of forces are established in defensive positions in the vicinity of vital logistics hubs, including <marker name='aeroport'>Aeroport de Tanoa</marker> in the south and <marker name='rochelle'>La Rochelle Aerodrome</marker> and <marker name='bpi'>Blue Pearl Industrial Port</marker> in the North East. In the south island <marker name='airstrip'>St George airstrip</marker> and the bridge crossing at <marker name='harcourt'>Harcourt</marker> are also occupied. SIGINT indicates that enemy HQ is likely to be in the vicinity of <marker name='georgetown'>Georgetown</marker> and subsequently heavily defended.<br />
    <br />
CSAT forces are well supplied and supported by airflift resupply into <marker name='rochelle'>La Rochelle Aerodrome</marker> in the north. Air transport assets are available to move CSAT infantry around the islands. HUMINT suggests CSAT may have attack helicopter capability available on the main island. Finally, CSAT have a number of armed coastal patrols using SDV, Assault Boats and divers.<br />
    <br />
CSAT are supported by the local Syndikat faction, believed to be in approx Company strength but spread thinly across the island. Their modus operandi is to occupy civilian establishments from where they establish points of control and act as a force multiplier for CSAT.<br />
    <br />
CIVPOP is present in small numbers and are mostly those that are too afraid to leave their homes and belongings. They do not pose a threat and are largely ambivalent to local and NATO forces. It goes without saying, avoid civilian casualties.    <br />    <br />
<font size='18'>FRIENDLY FORCES</font><br />
NATO Response Force 16 consists of a NATO Combined Arms Armoured Company (Draxl Company - HQ callsign CROSSROAD), including special forces reconnaissance elements (RAIDER), close air (EAGLE) and rotary wing support units (RODEO).<br />
<br />
NATO forces are located at the <marker name='respawn_west'>Bala Airstrip</marker>, which has been secured as a ""beachhead"" onto the Horizon Islands. The company size force will secure and consolidate their position around Bala Airstrip, while special forces elements and support units look to opportunistically disrupt OPFOR operations on the main island.
