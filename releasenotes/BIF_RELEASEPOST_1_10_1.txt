[b]Civilian Overhaul and more![/b]
This release sees a massive overhaul of the Ambient Civilian functionality, making the streets, towns and battlefields of Arma even more ALiVE than before... If you haven't tried ALiVE Ambient Civilians, now is the time to try it out! Check out the 2 minute set up video here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eApOtnpcOo

Thanks to community feedback and testing we noticed that Ambient Civilians and to some extent civilian insurgencies were not working as intended. Not only have we fixed those issues but we've massively improved the ambient civilian population functionality. This includes:

* Ambient Civilians now dynamically spawn and despawn around players in small or large urban areas to create a true feeling that villages and towns are ALiVE.
* An additional layer of ambient civilians (crowds) now spawn and despawn from buildings around players, creating large numbers of civilians in built up areas.
* Ambient Civilians and crowds will carry on with daily life, moving between buildings, visiting mosques, churches, shops, observing local forces and starting noisy crowds.
* Civilians can now throw objects when they are upset or hostile.
* Civiilan crowds will cheer and boo with appropriate animations.  Thanks to IndeedPete for Arma 2 animations.
* Civilians will now flee for cover if armed factions start shooting. Ambient civilians may scream in terror during combat.
* BUT WAIT! There's more... thanks to AUTigerGrad we've added faction specific environment sounds too. When you enter villages and towns you will hear faction appropriate sounds of daily life.
* Ambient civilian sounds are currently available for CUP and CFP African and Middle-East civilains factions as well as vanilla Arma 3 civilian factions.
* A custom building sound system has been implemented, initially supporting call to prayer from minarets and mosques. This system can be extended to support any building type.
* Number of civilians spawned from buildings, spawn radius and spawn limiter can be configured from the Ambient Civilian Population module.
* Finally, rumour has it that Spyder's Civilian Interaction functionality is being ported into ALiVE to work with the updated Ambient Civilians...

Other highlights for this release include:
* Added support for the Global Mobilization terrain! Thanks to the GM team for their support.
* Added support for the Kujari terrain.
* Added the ability to define multiple items for access to Combat Support.
* We have fixed an issue where ammo crates could not be unloaded from vehicles when called in via Player Resupply.
* We have also fixed an issue where additional units were spawned in certain vehicles with gunners.
* Fixed an issue where Independent sides were not treated equally
* Removed blacklisted vehicles from roadblocks
