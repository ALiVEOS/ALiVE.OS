[b]Hackathon and bugs squashing[/b]

On a dark, cold and damn early Friday morning in London, at a secret location, the ALiVE mod team got together for its very first Hackathon! 5 devs travelled to London while members from Australia, Europe and the US connected remotely for what ended up as 16 hours of bug smashing and playtesting. After some initial technical issues (apologies on the lack of live stream and updates), the crew were up and running, fueled by a full english breakfast, pizza, coffee and prosecco(!) we smashed through numerous bugs. 1.2.8 release is the culmination of that work. Many thanks to Friznit for hosting, and to those that travelled - Tupolov, Gunny, Jman and Sacha - as well as our fellow ALiVE modders across the world. 

We certainly look forward to the next ALiVE Hackathon in 2017.
