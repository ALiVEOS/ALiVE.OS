[size=4]The next generation dynamic persistent mission addon for ArmA3[/size][/b][/center]
[center][b]Release 1.3.7[/b][/center]
[center]Return of the MACC[/center]
 
[b]Air Tasking Orders[/b]
The second iteration of the Military Air Component Commander (MACC) includes a full suite of Air Tasking Orders (ATO).  As well as setting Combat Air Patrols (CAP), Air Command can now scramble Defensive Counter Air (DCA) against incoming enemy strike aircraft, order Offensive Counter Air (OCA) against enemy airfields and Suppression of Enemy Air Defences (SEAD) against detected Ground Based Air Defences (GBAD).  MACC has been integrated into the ground forces chain of command, so the Military AI Commander can request Close Air Support (CAS) for troops in contact or Recce and Strike missions on enemy held objectives.  The AI Commander's decision-action cycle has been adjusted to accomodate the new capabilities.  OPCOM requests aerial recce on large objective (>150) in hostile areas then calls OCA if air assets are detected or CAS if armoured units are spotted.

Air Tasking Orders have been integrated with the C2ISTAR module's autogenerated player tasks.  If no AI aircraft are available, MACC will offer the ATO to players.  The Combat Search and Rescue autogen task has been updated to direct players to recover downed pilots from actual aircraft crash sites.  We're planning to add more integrated C2ISTAR tasks in future so that players can contribute directly to the AI generated ground war.

In other news, thanks to feedback from Vegas and others, we have reviewed the way CQB persistence works.  Previously you had to clear an entire sector completely for it to persist as cleared, which could be frustrating if you missed a building in a thousand metre square city.  The size of area that you must clear has been reduced tenfold and once all known sub sectors are clear, the entire CQB sector is considered clear for the purposes of persistence.

Finally, a couple of important house keeping notes for mission editors and server admins
1. Since APEX assets are now available to all, the APEX compositions have been merged into the main branch and are no longer in optional folder
2. We have started updating our modules to support the 3DEN configuration (Player Options, ALiVE Required, C2ISTAR).  In case of issues, simply delete and replace the modules and check the modules settings.
3. Logistics replacements for destroyed aircraft is coming in the next release.  For now, when all aircraft are lost or destroyed MACC will exit.
