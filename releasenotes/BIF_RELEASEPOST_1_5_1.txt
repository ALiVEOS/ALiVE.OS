[size=4]The next generation dynamic persistent mission addon for ArmA3[/size][/b][/center]
[center][b]Release 1.5.1[/b][/center]
 
[b]Hackathon 2017[/b]
Last month the dev team got together for our annual 24 hour hackathon where we focus our efforts to smash some knotty bugs and finish off as many WIP features as we can.  We also eat a lot of pizza and play test ALiVE to death (usually ours).

We have added a simple respawn for destroyed MACC aircraft although they will not yet retain custom pylon loadouts for manually placed aircraft.  That will come when we add full integration with the Military Logistics framework.  However, we have added this feature to Player Combat Support aircraft.

C2ISTAR tasks have had an overhaul and should now be more robust.  Tasks are a popular feature of ALiVE but the existing randomly generated tactical tasks are only a placeholder.  Our vision is to have autogenerated missions fully integrated with the AI Ground, Air and Logistics Command so that players are directed to support the AI Commander's current objectives.  We have built the framework for the Strategic Tasks system and integrated some Air Tasking Orders, which will be assigned to players and AI flying combat aircraft.  Ground and Logistics tasks will be added in due course.

The ALiVE Quickstart mission has been updated so should work properly now.  We've also added a simple multiplayer scenario on Malden, mostly aimed at demonstrating how to set up a basic ALiVE mission in Eden - feel free to pull it apart and have a look.

[b]ALiVE War Room Notice[/b]
[url=http://alivemod.com/#ALiVEWarRoom]ALiVE War Room[/url] has always been free at the point of use and has relied on the generosity of the community to cover server costs.  Unfortunately after 5 years of continuous service there are no longer sufficient funds to support maintenance costs.  We are exploring alternative funding options but in the event that we have to close down the War Room, you will obviously lose access to the ALiVE cloud services.  You can still use the local persistence option in the ALiVE Data module for mission and player persistence (this is the preferred approach anyway).  For clarity, the following cloud services are provided by ALiVE War Room and will no longer be available when the server is shut down:

Remote storage of persistent mission states
Operations, player and clan statistics
Mission recording and After Action Review
Server performance monitoring
Clan management tools
ALiVE forum signature blocks

We urge all Groups/Clans using ALiVE War Room to donate as soon as possible. The current planned shutdown date is January 10th 2018, unless further community donations are forthcoming. Please go here to [url=http://alivemod.com/#Donate]Donat[/url]
