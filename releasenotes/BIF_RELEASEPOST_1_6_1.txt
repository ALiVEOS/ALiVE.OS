[size=4]The next generation dynamic persistent mission addon for ArmA3[/size][/b][/center]
[center][b]Release 1.6.1[/b][/center]
 
[b]A New Chapter[/b]
Firstly, we're very excited to announce that ArmaHosts have kindly offered to host the ALiVE War Room! This means cloud saving, AAR and stats are all back in action and War Room functionality has returned to normal! A massive thank you to Justin and the crew at ArmaHosts! With the server migration we removed game saves prior to April 6th, all stats and events/AAR remain.

As the Arma 3 roadmap sees its final DLC ship, the ALiVE team are now very much moving into maintenance mode. Expect only minor updates to address any major bugs or issues as the Arma 3 platform is updated. Of course the ALiVE codebase is now completely open source so if anyone contributes fixes, new features, optimizations we will absolutely ensure these get released.

For this release we have lots of bug fixes, new map indexes (for IFA thanks to HeroesandVillainsOS!) and we're announcing support for the Community Factions Project! We wanted to ensure that factions in CFP can operate in ALiVE and have access to supplies, logistics, civilian weapons etc. We have also updated Orbat Creator with additional functionality that makes it easier for the CFP team (and anyone else!) to create factions in Arma 3.

[b]Release Highlights[/b]
Civilian Population - Added support for CUP Takistani civilians and CFP civilian factions
Military Logistics - Added support for CFP factions
Orbat Creator - Ability to auto generate faction crate configs, auto generate faction preview images (use Virtual Reality map), support for disabling ORBAT loadouts in 3DEN. Minor fixes.
Map Indexes - Added: 10 IFA winter maps, Chernarus Redux Updated: Isla Duala
Various - Performance and crash fixes
