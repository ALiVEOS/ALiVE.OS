HOW TO - Creating Images of Mod Weapons and Vehicles for War Room.

NOTE: These steps must be performed on your client machine.

Step 1 	Create a folder called exportCfg in your Arma 3 directory 	

Step 2 	Copy render.pbo from the Arma 3 Tools directory (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Arma 3 Tools\RenderWorlds) to your @ALiVE/addons folder. Arma 3 Tools can be installed from Steam. 	

Step 3 	Download scr_cap.dll from http://killzonekid.com/pub/scr_cap_v1.0.zip and extract scr_cap.dll to your @ALiVE folder. 	

Step 4 	Launch Arma 3 with your mod enabled.
1. Select Editor from the main menu and select Render map.
2. In the Editor, select Load and select the ALiVE War Room Image Capture mission 	

Step 5 	Open each of the triggers in the mission (double click on the flags). In the OnAct box change the prefix parameter to match your mod i.e. change CUP to your TAG. For example, RHS CfgPatches(pbos) rhsusf_weapons (rhsusf_weapons.pbo), the prefix would be RHS. 	

Step 6 	Alternatively, you can add an additional parameter that specifies the exact CfgPatches (PBOs) to choose, i.e. ["A3_weapons","A3_weapons_beta"].
For example, in the OnAct text box for the trigger:
null = [] spawn { ["screenshots","",["CUP_Weapons","CUP_Shiny_Weapons"]] call ALiVE_fnc_exportCfgWeapons; } 	

Step 7 	Preview the mission and change your video settings:
1. Ensure quality is set to Ultra
2. Set visibility to 500
3. Ensure display is set to Fullscreen Window mode (NOT fullscreen) and increase brightness to 1.5.
4. Change your AA & PP settings, turn off bloom, turn off depth of field, increase sharpen to 200. 	

Step 8 	Press 0 then 0 again to bring up radio menu
